# My SoME_Video

**[Moment of inertia of fractals geometry](https://github.com/thanniti/SoME_Video)**
this website contain my project workflow

## Workflow

### Intro to fractal
  1. Scene1
     - Creature ask "There are many type of fractals"
     - Show different variable of fractals
     - Focus on Sierpinski triagle , Van koch curve
  2. Scene2
     - Creature talk "There are many property of these fractals 
       but, the one that we gonna discuss in this video is the moment of inertia"
     - Show fractals spin around axes
### Intro to Moment of inertia  
  3. Scene3
     - fill screen with fractal spin in scene2
     - Creature ask "but what is moment of inertia"
     - Change fractal spinning in to disk
     - Creature disappear
     - Write def of moment of inertia
     - Write formula
    


```python
from manim import*
from fractals_construct import
import math
import numpy as np

class Main_Scene(Scene):
  def __innit__(self,**kwarg)
  super().__innit__(**kwarg)

class Scene1(Main_Scene):
  def construct(self):

class Scene2(Main_Scene):
  def construct(self):
  
class Scene3(Main_Scene):
  def construct(self):
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/thanniti/SoME_Video/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
